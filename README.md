# Instructions
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
1. Look at the screenshot.png file. Discuss how you think the filter might work. The `All` option can be either `All` or `Any`.
1. Look at the order-schema-filters.json file. This is the schema that the filter will be applied to.
1. You can run tests with `npm run test`.
1. You can run type checking with `npm run compile`.
1. Fill out filters.ts and filter.test.ts to implement the filter.

# Guidelines

- Work iteratively. Get small chunks of work done and then move onto the next. Describe what that might look like to you.

# AI Tools During Your Interview

Use AI tools freely (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) — we want to see how you think, decide, and collaborate with AI, not whether you can out-code it. We can provide an Anthropic API key if needed.

What We're Looking For

**Thoughtful prompting** — Describe problems clearly with context and constraints. Steer the model iteratively, not with one-shot "solve it" prompts.

**Your reasoning** — Explain how you break down problems, evaluate trade-offs, and make decisions.

**Critical review** — Critique AI output on correctness, structure, naming, and style. Say what you'd change and why.

**Ownership** — Treat AI as a collaborator, not an oracle. Verify outputs, run tests, and understand before adopting.

**Adaptability** — When requirements shift or things break, explain your adjustments and trade-off reasoning.

**Engineering taste** — Code must be clear, maintainable, and safe. AI doesn't excuse poor structure or missing tests.

Good AI Usage

- Outline approach before prompting
- Use AI for scaffolding/boilerplate, not complete solutions
- Iterate and critique outputs
- Add your own refactors, tests, documentation
- Verify correctness and performance

Avoid

- Pasting code you don't understand
- Treating first answers as final
- Over-prompting instead of reasoning
- Skipping edge cases or tests

Bottom Line

Think aloud. Use AI to accelerate, not replace understanding. We're evaluating your judgment, communication, and engineering instincts — not just the final code.
